# Binary-Expression-tree
Binary expression tree is a way of writing an expression in the form of binary tree.Here expression operators remain in the stem node.And digits remain in the leaf node.We start calculation from the most bottom subtree and move upwards.An example is given for you.
      *
   5     +
      3    2
this tree is equivalent to 5*(3+2).We perform the most bottom tree at first which is 3+2. then we multiply that with 5 which is upper tree
